If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

Here is a data of the user's listening preferences based on average energy, valence and danceability

ENERGY
Average energy of music is 0.659

VALENCE
Average valence of music is 0.484

DANCEABILITY
0.716

Conclusion:
The valence of music the user listens to was average. This means that the user listens to both sad and happy songs. Therefore, I will conclude that the person is from the Blue mood group.


Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
There is a need for more data on what music the user listens to as the data from the top 100 songs might not give enough information about the user.
