sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?:

reversed50,000.txt -> 5.386s
sorted50,000.txt -> 0.644s

for sorted files, sort1 was the fastest in sorting them.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?:

reversed50,000.txt -> 0.459s

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?:

reverse50,000.txt -> 4.021s
sorted50,000.txt -> 3.574s

It was the slowest sorting  program in both a reversed number text file, as well as a sorted text file. Hence we can conclude that this is selection sort.
